	=============================================================

	   Essential for easy template sharing. You have to load and save
	   your personal templates once only to have them up-to-date.
	2. Improved video "Preview" option. Fixed time display and
	   seeking problems with some file types. 
	3. fixed bug where Avanti occasionally failed to check if the
	   used FFmpeg version supports the (valid) cancel option.

	   handle quoted strings properly.
	5. added path redirection for rambling x264 2-pass logs.
	6. Fixed bug in loading of SuperEQ presets.
	7. Fixed bugs in the ".user" file extension option. 
	8. Did a lot of re-writing on the Avanti-Help.chm especially
	   on the database and register procedure. More pictures.

	   lists and select pages, then press <F1>.


	AVANTI 0.2.0 -- FFmpeg/AviSynth GUI -- Changelog 27-09-2007.
	=============================================================

	1. Templates now store their associated codec database entry.
	   This makes it very easy to exchange templates that contain
	   other then the by default registered FFmpeg codecs.
	   Avanti will automatically update the database if it finds
	   a unregistered codec in the template.
	2. Added template for Flash Video (user contribution).
	3. Fixed several minor bugs.
	4. Found the main cause of the Avanti/FFmpeg/AviSynth problem
	   with a lot of help from 45tripp (forums VideoHelp.com).
	   Read the included "readme.txt" file for more details. 
	5. New approach for Vista toolbar. Test GUI did fine, so...?
	6. Rewritten the chm help somewhat but it will be revised as
	   soon as I find the time for it. Also working on context
	   sensitive help.

	   This will show the command line of the last encode process.
	2. Added option to cleanup the Windows "temp" directory from
	   XviD 2-pass log files (xvidff.x). Set "xvid_log=KEEP" to
	   "xvid_log=REMOVE" in the Avanti.ini file to switch it on.
	3. Improved 2-pass encoding (command line, reporting).  
	4. Fixed bug in destination "Preview" option for elemetary streams.
	5. Fixed a bug that corrupted user given paths on command lines.
	   Note that Avanti always converts to Linux paths (slashes).
	6. Changed some code to trace the AviSynth problem which shows up
	   on some machines.
	7. New attempt to fix the Vista toolbar bug on remote.
	   Waiting for a Vista machine to be able to trace/fix the bug.
