	What is Frei0r ...

	Frei0r is a minimalistic plugin API for video effects. The main emphasis
	is on simplicity for an API that will round up the most common video effects
	into simple filters, sources and mixers that can be controlled by parameters.
	It’s our hope that this way these simple effects can be shared between many
	applications, avoiding their reimplementation by different projects.
